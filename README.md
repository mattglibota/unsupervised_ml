# Unsupervised ML: Crypto
## Module 18

### Summary
Code is located in **module18_challenge.ipynb**
Raw file is located in **crypto_data.csv**

I ran the k-means with 4 clusters initiated with a 3 component PCA transformation.

The model classified one coin into its own cluster, BitTorrent. The remaining clusters are:
1) Proof Types containing PoS or PoC
2) Half the algorithms with proof types containing PoW
2) Algorithms with proof types containing PoW that do not typically have coins with proof types containing PoS or PoC
